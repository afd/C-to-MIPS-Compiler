Date,Effort,Developers,Milestones,Description
24th Feb,1,AK,LEX,created simple lexer
24th Feb,4,AK,PAR,first approach at parser creation. thought about classes needed for the AST. 
24th Feb,3,AK,AST,added top node and statements skeleton + first implementation
3rd Mar,2,AK,PAR,changed parser design to be fully compliant with C90 spec. first compilation of parser
3rd Mar,5,AK,AST,changed classes structure - added new definitions of classes
10th Mar,4,AK,PAR,improvements in parser and AST interactions
10th Mar,30,AK,AST,implemented most crucial classes (not full implementation) such as functions primitives variables scope list in order to be able to parse a simple function
17th Mar,15,AK,AST,implemented more classes to be able to start to work on python. started pyPrint
17th Mar,22,AK,PY,python translation. each class has pyPrint. worked on indentation. global variables work. translator begins to function properly
17th Mar,3,AK,LEX,added full lexer to conform C90 spec
24th Mar,5,AK,PY,added advanced features to python. python printing is done. elif implemented. indentation works. workaroud to binary operation 
24th Mar,20,AK,AST,added classes for more complex features such as if statements function calls loops negative numbers. started implementing mipsPrint
24th Mar,35,AK,MIPS,started basic MIPS generation with help of utilities provided by Adam - Context & Chunk. functions assignment scopes ifs loops work postfix expressions
26th Mar,20,AK,MIPS,advanced features such as function calls;more arguments;multiple returns;full implementations of binary operators;global variables. DEBUGGING...
24th Feb,5,AU,RSTD,Get dragon book from library. Skim trough and gain understandning. Also skim trugh K
3rd Mar,5,AU,SWARCH,Finalise basic work division and define the system of Stack objects. This is a major step. Also Implement a trial version but throw it away.
10th Mar,5,AU,CI,"Set up travis CI, add Catch2 unit testing, add CLI"
17th Mar,18,AU,TYPE,Implement basic scoping and context
17th Mar,21,AU,STACK,Implement chunk loading and storing
17th Mar,10,AU,BACK,Add full unit testing of context and ensure good reliability. Interoberability between chunks and types
24th Mar,10,AU,MERGE,Merge with frontend
24th Mar,16,AU,INT,"Implement various features, duch as global and argument passing"
24th Mar,10,AU,ADV,Mainly function calling and argument passing
26th Mar,30,AU,,Debuggung and CI/CT
